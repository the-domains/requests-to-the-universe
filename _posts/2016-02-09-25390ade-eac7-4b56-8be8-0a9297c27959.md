This morning, on the beach, the sea foamed over the old-gold sand as warm and frothy as a baby's bath.

Manifesting how to live like it's heaven on earth seemed as easy as breathing, as natural as the pure air swirling around me.

The secret to living with joy can be simply asking. That's how Requests To The Universe came about. On the beach. Living like it's heaven on earth. Thinking about how to share this.

So there's no longer need to wait for permission. To do things the hard way.

Instead, grab your joy with both hands and laugh. Feel the blessings raining upon you.

You are reading this, you are here and free. You are already in the most blessed twenty per cent of the world. 

In truth, you are unique. There is no one like you. Not one other person in all the seven billion people on our planet is you. That's 7,000,000,000\. There is only you. The one perfectly imperfect you. 

And know this: all you most want can be yours.

I'm so thrilled that you're here. Truly. Together it's easy. We're not designed to struggle alone. We are neither dependent nor independent. We are interdependent. One huge, glorious, gleaming, throbbing universe. 

Each made of stardust and stories.

**Now's your time to Flow With Ease And Make An Impact**

It's so easy to say this isn't a perfect world. Yes you have competing  priorities. 

Let's discover together the power of these Requests To The Universe.

All of those thoughts that you have tumbling in your mind, committed to a scrap of paper somewhere, lost, jumbling, tiring you. Let's choose one. Your most important of your Requests To The Universe.

Just one baby at a time.

What do you want to Request? What's the ultimate goal, not just a stepping stone?

For example, money is all around you. It's captured energy. It's important. You can do huge good with money and energy. You serve no-one by playing small.

**This is your time to make the very first of your Requests To The Universe.**

It's time for you to take ten deep, slow breaths and begin. 

Enjoy it. Make it with intention: clearly see what you're Requsting as if it's already happening right now.

Feel how good it is to step into your future in this way. 

Deep breaths.

Feel excited about getting underway and seeing all this goodness you are Requesting. The change you are manifesting. It's already started.

I know this will help you a lot and I can't wait to hear how you go.

When you live into your Requests To The Universe in this way, you see opportunities and next steps all around you. Breathe deeply. Live mindfully. See the actions to take. And take them.

Abundance loves action. Requests require resolution and follow through.

You've got this.

You are made of stardust and dreams.

You are as much a part of this Universe as the largest galaxy and the smallest quark. You are totally unique. It's time to live your best life. Play full tilt. Make your **Requests To The Universe** and let the fun begin.
